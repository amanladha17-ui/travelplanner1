#  Travel Planner

A simple, user-friendly **travel planning website** that helps users plan their journeys more efficiently by integrating multiple travel elements (routes, costs, booking links, layover suggestions, and destination guides) into one platform.  

This project is being developed iteratively using Agile Sprints. The current version is the **Walking Skeleton (Sprint 1)**, providing a minimal end-to-end workflow.
